[Experimental Draft Ontology (OWL)](https://github.com/casework/case/tree/master/case.ttl) | [Natural Language Glossary](case-v0.1.0-natural-language-glossary.html) | [Releases](https://github.com/casework/case/releases)

Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) is a community-developed standard format, which is intended to serve the needs of the broadest possible range of cyber-investigation domains, including digital forensic science, incident response, and counter-terrorism. 

CASE is defined as a profile of the [Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO)](https://github.com/ucoProject/). CASE leverages contextually relevant components of the UCO extending, constraining or renaming them as appropriate.

CASE is specified at a semantic level and supports various serializations. The default serialization for CASE is JSON-LD.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a foundation for broader community involvement in defining what to represent and how.
